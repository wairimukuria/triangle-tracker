## Description

its an application that tracks/checks and returns what type a triangle is based on the data input put that specifies values of the triangle sides.the application user is prompted to input a value equivalent to the first side of a triangle after inputting the application again prompts the user to enter a second value which represents the second side of the triange and upon inputting the second the user will be prompted to input a third value of the third side of the triangle.the application then computes the sides and outputs a statement to tell if the triangle is isosceles,scalene or equilateral.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

All the application requires is a text editor to run the code and a web browser of choice by the user to launch it.however the JavaScript and CSS scripts need to be run to ensure proper application functionality.

## Behaviour Driven Development

the application functionality is mostly what is put into first consideration when developing the application that is factors such as how the user needs to input values and the application outputs what kind of a triangle that is depending on the values and project specifications in the code using the right JavaScript functions and methods.

## Technologies Used

The application is built on the hypertext markup language(HTML)with the use of custom made stylesheets that use cascading,box models and floats, CSS and JavaScript using the for loop to run the specifications of the application and give output.
